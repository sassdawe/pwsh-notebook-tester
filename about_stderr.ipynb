    "Explains how to redirect output from PowerShell to text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Long description\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, PowerShell sends output to the PowerShell host. Usually this is\n",
    "the console application. However, you can redirect the output to a text\n",
    "file and you can redirect error output to the regular output stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the following methods to redirect output:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Use the Out-File cmdlet, which sends command output to a text file.\n",
    "    Typically, you use the Out-File cmdlet when you need to use its\n",
    "    parameters, such as the Encoding, Force, Width, or NoClobber\n",
    "    parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Use the Tee-Object cmdlet, which sends command output to a text file\n",
    "    and then sends it to the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Use the PowerShell redirection operators. Using the redirection\n",
    "    operator with a file target is functionally equivalent to piping to\n",
    "    Out-File with no extra parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about streams, see about_Output_Streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Redirectable output streams\n",
    "\n",
    "PowerShell supports redirection of the following output streams.\n",
    "\n",

    "There is also a PROGRESS stream in PowerShell, but it doesn't support\n",

    "\n",
    "  [!IMPORTANT] The SUCCESS and ERROR streams are similar to the stdout and\n",

    "  PowerShell pipeline for input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "PowerShell redirection operators\n",

    "The PowerShell redirection operators are as follows, where n represents the\n",

    "specified.\n",
    "\n",

    "Example 2: Send all Success stream data to a file\n",
